# Printing Instructions

- OG star tracker mini: Print everything at 100% infill, except large pulley you can use 50% infill.
- For ball head holder, between part and stationary part you can use 50% infill
- For main part, use supports. Support overhang angle is 80°.
- STL files that have "2x" at the end, need to be printed twice.
- If you are confused, look at the 3D model.
- If you don't have M5 threaded inserts, use STLs that have "with thread" in the file name.
- For now, don't print top cover because the software is not ready yet.
- If you don't want to have intervalometer, print top cover without display.
- Software would be hopefully ready in few days.
- Don't forget that this is still beta.
- You can use 0.6mm nozzle.
- Use PLA for printing.
- Parts are oriented in printing position.
- Use supports only on this part: main part, overhang angle 80°
- Print M5 bolt cap twice
- If you think I have missed something, message me.
- Soon I will upload part bottom main part for peoples living below 20°.

Clear skies!
