# OG-star-tracker-

Is a fully 3d printed upgradable star tracker that you can make for 60$, I have been working on it for the past two years. It can handle
up to 300mm and 2.5kg. It's also upgradable which means that you can add a another axis which would allow you to use go-to.Don't hesitate to ask me.
